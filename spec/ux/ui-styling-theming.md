# UI Styling & Theming

## Purpose
This document defines the complete styling and theming system for the Limelight‑X Avalonia workflow dashboard.  
It specifies the color palette, typography, component styling, iconography, animations, and branding rules.  
This specification is authoritative.  
All implementation must follow this styling system exactly.

The UI embodies the **Limelight** identity:  
a dark, neon‑accented, spotlight‑inspired aesthetic that supports analysts and citizen developers while maintaining a clean, deterministic workflow dashboard feel.

---

# 1. High‑Level Styling Overview

Limelight‑X uses a **dark neon aesthetic** with a **neon‑lime accent**, inspired by stage lighting and the “limelight” metaphor.

Core characteristics:

- Dark background  
- Neon lime accent used **sparingly** for highlights and active states  
- Soft shadows and subtle depth  
- Compact layout density  
- VS Code‑style syntax highlighting  
- Fluent UI iconography  
- Strong branding in header and key workflow areas  
- Deterministic animations (100–150ms)  
- Fixed theme system for v0.1 (no extensibility)

Light mode exists but is secondary; dark mode is the default.

# 2. Color Palette

## 2.1 Base Colors (Dark Theme)
```
BackgroundPrimary: #0D0D0D
BackgroundSecondary: #1A1A1A
Surface: #1F1F1F
SurfaceHover: #262626
Border: #333333
TextPrimary: #E5E5E5
TextSecondary: #B3B3B3
TextMuted: #808080
```

## 2.2 Accent Colors (Neon Lime)
Accent is used **sparingly** for active states, selection, and key workflow highlights.

```
AccentPrimary: #10B981   // Neon green (base)
AccentGlow: #32FF9C      // Brighter lime for glow effects
AccentMuted: #0A8F63     // Darker lime for subtle states
```

## 2.3 Error & Status Colors
```

Warning: #F59E0B
Info: #3B82F6
Success: #10B981
```

## 2.4 Light Theme (Secondary)
Light theme mirrors dark theme values but uses muted lime instead of neon.

```
BackgroundPrimary: #FFFFFF
BackgroundSecondary: #F5F5F5
Surface: #FAFAFA
Border: #DDDDDD
TextPrimary: #1A1A1A
TextSecondary: #4D4D4D
AccentPrimary: #10B981
```

---

# 3. Typography

Limelight‑X uses a dual‑font system:

### UI Font
```
Inter (Regular, Medium, SemiBold)
```

### Code & Editor Font
```
JetBrains Mono (Regular, Medium)
```

### Rules
- All inspector panels use Inter.  
- Editor uses JetBrains Mono exclusively.  
- No font substitutions.  
- Line height must be consistent and deterministic.

---

# 4. Component Styling

## 4.1 General Component Style
Limelight‑X uses **soft shadows + subtle depth**:

```
ShadowSmall: 0px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.4)
ShadowMedium: 0px 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.35)
BorderRadius: 6px
BorderColor: #333333
```

### Rules
- No heavy shadows.  
- No flat design.  
- No high‑contrast borders except error states.  
- Depth must be subtle and deterministic.

---

## 4.2 Buttons
Primary buttons use **accent sparingly**:

```
Background: Surface
Border: AccentPrimary
Text: AccentPrimary
Hover: SurfaceHover
ActiveGlow: AccentGlow (subtle outer glow)
```

Secondary buttons:

```
Background: Surface
Border: BorderColor
Text: TextPrimary
Hover: SurfaceHover
```

Disabled buttons:

```
Background: #1A1A1A
Text: #555555
Border: #2A2A2A
```

---

## 4.3 Inspector Panels
Inspector panels use **card‑style surfaces**:

```
Background: Surface
Border: BorderColor
Shadow: ShadowSmall
HeaderText: TextPrimary
HeaderAccent: AccentPrimary (only when active)
```

### Collapse/Expand
- Chevron icon from Fluent UI  
- Minimal deterministic animation (100–150ms)  
- No bounce, overshoot, or easing curves beyond linear or ease‑out

---

## 4.4 Tree Views (AST Panels & File Tree)
Tree views follow **VS Code dark theme**:

- Chevron expanders  
- Indentation guides  
- Syntax‑colored node text (AST panels) / file‑type icon + name (file tree)  
- Hover highlight: `SurfaceHover`  
- Selected node: subtle lime border (`AccentMuted`)

`FileTreeView` (`ui-components.md` §3.1) reuses these same tree‑styling tokens rather than introducing new ones — it is styled as a sibling of the AST inspector tree views, not a distinct component style.

---

## 4.5 IR Operation Cards
Operation cards use:

```
Background: Surface
Border: BorderColor
Shadow: ShadowSmall
HeaderAccent: AccentPrimary (only for active operation)
SyntaxHighlighting: VS Code Dark+
```

---

## 4.6 Prompt & Model Output Blocks
Rendered using:

- VS Code Dark+ syntax highlighting  
- Markdown styling  
- Table rendering with alternating row backgrounds  
- JSON syntax coloring  
- No neon accents except for active selection

---

## 4.7 Form Inputs (Settings Modal)
`TextField`, `SecureTextField`, and `SelectField` (see `ui-components.md` §5.6–5.8) reuse existing tokens rather than introducing new ones:

```
Background: Surface
Border: BorderColor
Focus Border: AccentPrimary
Text: TextPrimary
Label: TextSecondary
Error Border: Error (#EF4444)
```

- No new colors, shadows, or animation timings beyond those already defined in §2, §4.1, and §7.  
- `SecureTextField`'s show/hide toggle uses a Fluent UI icon (eye / eye-off), per §6.

---

## 4.8 Tab Strip
The tab strip (`ui-components.md` §3.2) is a genuinely new component with no prior analog (the retired Sidebar had no tab concept). It reuses existing tokens:

```
Background: BackgroundSecondary
ActiveTab Background: Surface
ActiveTab Indicator: AccentPrimary (top or bottom border, 2px)
InactiveTab Text: TextSecondary
ActiveTab Text: TextPrimary
DirtyIndicator: a small filled dot in AccentPrimary, replacing the close icon on hover
CloseIcon: Fluent UI Dismiss icon, per §6
Hover: SurfaceHover
```

- No new shadow or animation timing — collapse/expand's existing 100–150ms linear/ease‑out rule applies to tab open/close if animated at all.  
- Explorer pane width (previously the Sidebar's fixed 180px) is **resizable** with a minimum width; exact default/minimum values are left to implementation, not fixed by this spec.

---

## 4.9 MenuBar & About Modal
The MenuBar (`ui-components.md` §3.5) and About modal (`ui-components.md` §7.2) introduce **no new tokens** — both reuse existing ones:

```
MenuBar Background: BackgroundSecondary
MenuBar Text: TextPrimary
Item Hover / Open: SurfaceHover
Item Open Accent: AccentPrimary (subtle highlight on the open top-level menu)
Dropdown Surface: Surface
Dropdown Border: BorderColor
Dropdown Shadow: ShadowMedium
Disabled Item: same tokens as Disabled Buttons (§4.2)
Shortcut Hint Text: TextSecondary
About Modal Scrim: #CC000000 (same overlay as Settings)
About Modal Surface: Surface
GitHub Link Text: AccentPrimary
```

- `ShadowMedium` (defined in §4.1) sees its first actual use here for the MenuBar's open dropdown surface — previously defined but unused elsewhere.  
- The GitHub link is the first hyperlink‑style text element in the UI; it uses `AccentPrimary` text, consistent with the existing accent‑sparingly rule (§2.2) — this is a new *usage* of an existing token, not a new token.  
- No new animation timings — dropdown open/close, if animated, follows the existing 100–150ms linear/ease‑out rule (§7).

---

## 4.10 SplitterControl
The `SplitterControl` (`ui-components.md` §4.5) — used both between the editor and execution panel, and on each inspector panel's resize handle — introduces **no new tokens**, reusing existing ones:

```
Handle Idle: TextPrimary (off-white, deliberately higher-contrast than Border so the handle reads as discoverable/draggable rather than blending into the surrounding card borders)
Handle Hover: AccentPrimary
Cursor: row-resize (both usages are horizontal dividers for a vertical split)
```

- Exact default height/ratio and minimum sizes are left to implementation, not fixed by this spec — the same treatment already given to the Explorer pane's resizable width (§4.8).  
- No new shadow or animation timing; the idle→hover color transition follows the existing 100–150ms linear/ease‑out rule (§7).

---

# 5. Syntax Highlighting

Limelight‑X uses **VS Code Dark+** as the base theme.

### CNL Highlighting Rules
- Keywords: `#569CD6`  
- Pronouns: `#4EC9B0`  
- Resources: `#CE9178`  
- Expression holes: `#C586C0`  
- Strings: `#D69D85`  
- Errors: `#EF4444` underline  
- Editor cursor: `AccentPrimary` (thin lime bar)

---

# 6. Iconography

Limelight‑X uses **Fluent UI icons** exclusively.

### Rules
- Chevron icons for collapsible panels and file tree folder nodes  
- Fluent folder/file icons for the file tree (`FileTreeView`), including distinct icons per common file type where available  
- Fluent run/explain icons (no Trace icon — the Trace trigger is removed, see `ui-viewmodels.md` §6)  
- Fluent Dismiss icon for tab close buttons  
- Fluent gear icon for the Settings entry point (persistent title/activity‑bar icon, `ui-components.md` §3.4)  
- MenuBar items (`ui-components.md` §3.5) are **text‑only, no icons** — consistent with compact layout density and requiring no new Fluent icons  
- No Material icons  
- No custom SVGs in v0.1  

---

# 7. Animations

Animations must be:

- deterministic  
- minimal  
- 100–150ms duration  
- linear or ease‑out only  
- no bounce, wobble, or spring physics

### Animated Elements
- Collapse/expand panels  
- Hover transitions  
- Button active glow  

### Non‑Animated Elements
- Tree view expanders  
- Syntax highlighting  
- Editor cursor  
- Error banners

---

# 8. Branding

Limelight‑X uses **strong branding**:

### Branding Elements
- Neon lime accent  
- Limelight‑X logo in title bar  
- Branded header bar  
- Subtle spotlight/glow motif behind header  
- Accent used sparingly to avoid overwhelming the UI

### Rules
- Branding must not interfere with readability  
- Glow effects must be subtle  
- No animated branding  
- No background images behind content

---

# 9. Layout Density

Limelight‑X uses a **compact developer‑style layout**:

```
PaddingSmall: 4px
PaddingMedium: 8px
PaddingLarge: 12px
PanelSpacing: 8px
EditorLineHeight: 1.35
```

### Rules
- No excessive whitespace  
- Panels must be tightly stacked  
- Editor must feel like a code tool, not an enterprise dashboard  
- The `.llx` tab's editor/panel split default ratio, and each inspector panel's default expanded height, are implementation‑chosen — not fixed values in this spec, consistent with `PanelSpacing` and the other density tokens above being about spacing rules rather than exact pixel allocations.

---

# 10. Theme Extensibility

v0.1 uses a **fixed theme**:

- No theme packs  
- No user‑defined palettes  
- No runtime theme switching beyond light/dark  
- No custom accent colors  

Future versions may introduce extensibility.

---

# Summary

Limelight‑X uses a dark neon aesthetic with a sparingly applied neon‑lime accent, embodying the “limelight” identity.  
The UI is compact, developer‑friendly, and deterministic, with VS Code Dark+ syntax highlighting, Fluent UI icons, soft shadows, and subtle depth.  
Inspector panels use card‑style surfaces, AST panels use VS Code‑style tree views, and all animations are minimal and deterministic.  
The MenuBar and About modal introduce no new tokens, reusing existing surface, accent, and shadow tokens.  
This styling system is fixed for v0.1 and must be followed exactly.
